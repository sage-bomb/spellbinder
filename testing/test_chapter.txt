Chapter X: Lanterns for the Lost

They had been tracking it for two days.

It started with smoke—distant, strange, rising in a slow spiral from the north ridge. Then came the villagers: scattered, breathless, half-mad with fear. Something had come in the night, something that tore through the outpost and vanished before sunrise.

Sahla had seen Roan's face when he heard it described. He knew. Another one—death knight, or worse. They mounted up without speaking.

Even the mounts understood. Chi'Chi didn’t squawk, didn’t jostle, didn’t try to steal from anyone’s pack. He ran hard and silent, as if he knew this wasn’t just a chase—it was a reckoning. The horses kept pace, breath steady, eyes forward. There was no joking, no music, no drifting. They had a job to do.

They followed scorched soil and broken fences, charred marks in the shape of no living hand. Each mile narrowed the silence between them. Each step forward tightened the air.

And then they crested the ridge and saw the field.

The air still stank of ash and blood. The field was scattered with bodies—humans, elves, even a few dwarves. Soldiers, farmers. A few still clutching weapons. Most didn’t have time to draw them.

They had arrived too late.

Roan knelt beside one of the fallen. His brow furrowed. “These are fresh. Hours, maybe less.”

Tess scanned the scorched field, then the treeline. “It didn’t try to raise them.”

Roan stood, sword still drawn. “It knows we’re close. And it’s scared.”

Sahla looked at them both. “Then it’s still out there.”

Roan: “We need to come back and deal with this.”

But as they turned to leave, Chi’Chi hissed—head craned toward the road ahead.

There, in the center of the path, stood the death knight.

It didn’t run. Didn’t hide. It just waited—still and silent—as though it knew this would be its final reckoning.

What followed was brutal. Roan led the charge, blade humming with old power. Sahla flanked left, bow drawn, magic twisting along the string. Tess hung back at first—calculating, commanding—and then struck, tearing through its wards with searing precision.

The death knight fought like it had already lost. Not carelessly, but resigned. It parried, clawed, cast—but with a desperation that told them it wasn’t trying to win. It was trying to take someone with it.

Roan took a wound to the side, but held. Sahla landed the final arrow. Tess scattered its remaining necrotic power with a burning sigil she cast directly onto its chest.

When it fell, it didn’t scream. It just crumbled.

They didn’t speak for a long time.

Tess moved toward Roan immediately, already unwrapping a cloth from her belt pouch. She knelt beside him, pressing her hand gently to the side of his armor where the blow had landed.

Tess: “Hold still.”

He hissed slightly as she examined the gash.

Tess: “You got lucky. No shadow rot. Just torn muscle.”

Roan: “Good to know. Didn’t feel lucky.”

Tess gave him a look, then a faint smirk. “Well. You’re upright. That counts.”

Then they turned back to the field.

The group moved slowly among the carnage. Roan checked pulses he already knew would be still. Tess looked for sigils, emblems, anything to tell who they had been. Sahla knelt, again and again, closing eyes, smoothing hands, whispering apologies to people who would never hear them.

They gathered the bodies together—stacked not like firewood, but gently, with reverence. A circle of cloth, of fallen shields, of anything that could shelter the moment. They found no survivors.

The field was quiet now.

The wind had stilled. The ash had settled. The last body lay where they’d placed it—cleaned as best they could, covered in cloth, hands folded.

Sahla stood in the middle of it, arms limp at her sides, fists clenching and unclenching like she didn’t know what to do with her hands. Her mouth opened once. Closed. Opened again.

Sahla: “I don’t know what to do.”

Tess turned, gently setting down her satchel. Roan was a few paces behind, shoulders tight, eyes scanning for survivors even though they all knew there wouldn’t be any.

Sahla knelt by a body—a young woman, barely grown, still clutching a small knife. Her eyes were open to the sky. No armor. Just travel leathers and soot.

Sahla: “I don’t know their rites. I don’t know if they sing. If they bury. If they mark the body, or the earth, or the stars or the—”

She stopped.

Sahla: “—or the gods.”

The word caught in her throat. She didn’t say gods often. The Ara’net weren’t raised with them. Not prayers, not temples. Not hope in some unseen hand. Their survival was rooted in road, in will, in each other.

But this wasn’t about her. It wasn’t about belief. It was about these strangers—who they were, what they’d hoped for, what they might have whispered with their last breath.

Sahla: “What do you do? What do we do?”

Even Tess caught the hesitation. Sahla never talked about the gods—never invoked them, never gave them space. Hearing her say the word, even in grief, was like hearing a crack in something long thought solid.

Tess crouched beside her. She didn’t try to take her hand. She didn’t offer platitudes. She just breathed next to her, steady and sure.

Tess: “We tell the world they mattered.”

Tess: “We close their eyes. We say a name, even if we have to make one up. We light a fire, or build a cairn, or let the wind do what it does best.”

Tess: “And if none of that feels right—we let you do what you do.”

Sahla’s shoulders trembled.

Sahla: “But they’re not Ara’net.”

Tess: “And you don’t have to make them. You just have to honor them. Your way is beautiful.”

Tess: “Funerals aren’t for the dead, Sahla. They’re for the living. For the ones who stay behind and need to remember.”

Tess: “Let them walk your road, Sahla. It’s a good one.”

Sahla was crying now, not like someone broken, but like someone overflowing. Her shoulders shook in slow, rhythmic waves. Her hands were empty, held loosely in her lap. Her eyes didn’t move.

Sahla: “This is a tragedy.”

Tess sat beside her, silent.

Sahla: “It’s not just the dead. It’s the unmarked. The untold. There’s no song for them. No road to carry them. And I don’t even have the right kind of paper.”

Tess: “Paper?”

Sahla wiped her nose on her sleeve, then laughed bitterly.

Sahla: “Sky lanterns. On the Night of Remembrance, we write names—memories—on thin reed paper. Then we light the lanterns and send them up. It's not religious. Just… a way to let go without forgetting.”

Sahla: “Sometimes, if there’s a terrible loss—war, plague, disaster—we do it early. On the next moonless night. So they don’t have to wait to be remembered.”

She looked up, tear-streaked but steady.

Sahla: “This would qualify.”

Tess placed a hand gently on Sahla’s back. Not guiding. Just there.

Tess: “How many?”

Sahla: “What?”

Tess: “How many lanterns?”

Sahla: “Why?”

Tess didn’t answer with words.

She stood. Rolled up her sleeves. Breathed in. Her fingers moved—precise, elegant. Magic bloomed in the air, delicate and radiant. A lantern—not paper, but light—formed before them. Gently glowing. Rising with impossible stillness.

Sahla’s mouth fell open.

Tess: “One. How many more?”

Sahla stepped forward, watching with awe. Then her eyes narrowed slightly. She pointed.

Sahla: “Wait—the tops should curl more. They're rounder. And there's a sigil on the side—it’s not a name, it’s a direction. Aran'Sar for 'the road.'”

Tess glanced over, already reshaping the next with careful fingers.

Tess: “Got it.”

Another lantern formed. Then another.

Sahla: “Can I… try the last one?”

Tess looked at her.

Tess: “Yes. I’ll show you how.”

She stepped behind Sahla, reached around her—gently guiding Sahla’s arms and hands. Her fingers moved over Sahla’s like wind through silk, anchoring the weaves, steadying the core.

Tess: “Now. Think of light, but not heat. Think of breath—not your own. The kind you give away.”

Sahla’s hands glowed.

The last lantern took shape—wobbly, uneven, but real.

Tess blinked, genuinely impressed. This was well beyond what Sahla should’ve been able to manage at this point in her training. But the grief, the reverence, the sheer will to honor the dead—it steadied her. Tess barely had to correct her form.

They both raised their hands together, and the lantern lifted—slowly at first, then rising high, joining the others above the trees, where the sky had finally begun to open.

But there was still one more thing to do.

They looked across the field again, quiet now but heavy with presence. The bodies needed to be burned, but there wasn’t enough wood—not nearly. The field itself offered little more than dry grass and scattered twigs.

They worked quickly, clearing a circle around the dead so no wild spark would run through the brush. Tess murmured a containment ward around the edges while Roan stacked stones in the center—flat, heavy, solid. He arranged the weapons of the fallen around them in a loose ring.

Sahla stepped closer, eyes red.

Sahla: “What are you doing?”

Roan: “It’s a battlefield rite. Old one. We used it when we didn’t have time to do more. Weapons ringed to mark the fallen. Stones to say ‘someone cared.’”

Sahla nodded, then trembled.

Sahla: “We don’t have the wood. We can’t burn them.”

Tess stepped forward, slowly. Even she looked uneasy.

Tess: “I can do it. With mage fire.”

She raised a hand, then hesitated.

Tess: “It feels wrong. I’ve only ever used this in combat. Never for something like this.”

Sahla: “But it will give them the road?”

Tess nodded once.

Sahla: (softly) “Then they’ll travel well.”

Tess stepped forward. Magic began to hum around her, deep and resonant. Her feet lifted an inchs off the ground, skirts fluttering as if caught in an unseen breeze. She wasn’t just casting—she was channeling. The weave bent toward her, quiet and reverent.

Light curled around her hands. Her eyes shimmered like frost catching fire. She made a circle of light—slow, deliberate—and flame bloomed: white-gold, quiet, warm. A flame born not of destruction, but of letting go.

The fire took the bodies slowly, not with fury, but with respect. And the sky above them held the lanterns still rising.

Sahla: “Let the wind find you. Let the road carry you. Let what mattered stay.”

She stood a little longer, watching the lanterns fade higher into the darkness, their glow barely visible now.

Sahla: “We offer these lanterns for the lost.”
