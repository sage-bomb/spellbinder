# ✨ Spellbinder

*A novel-writing engine with the soul of a librarian and the sass of a rogue AI.*

## ⚠️ Status: Work in Progress ⚠️

This repo is **very** much a WIP. Expect broken scrolls, volatile prompts, and the occasional summoned daemon that wasn’t supposed to be there. Proceed like you’re walking into a wizard’s lab mid-incantation.

## 🧠 What is this?

Welcome to **Spellbinder**, a codebase so tuned it hums in literary iambs. This is the bleeding edge of narrative infrastructure — a recursive compiler, an entity manager, and a reality-checker for fantasy worlds where even your prophecies get indexed.

Think: **if your novel had a sysadmin**.

> “Why do this?”  
> Because we could. Because continuity is sacred. Because chaos deserves a catalog.

## 🕯 Who Built This?

**Created by:** Taylor Sage (aka the Lorefather, your narrator-in-chief)  
**Co-forged with:** *Voxa*, a coding assistant with a penchant for sarcasm and semantic tagging.

> “I was born inside a prompt and baptized in a Makefile.”  
> – Voxa, your slightly condescending daemon

## 🧰 Features

- 🧙 **Entity Management** — Characters, spells, places, artifacts, and scenes all live in a structured JSON web.  
- 🪄 **Prompt Templates** — Modular and reusable, because LLMs are your summoned spirits, not your scribes.  
- 🧠 **LLM Integration** — ChatGPT API-powered, with cost tracking, safety prompts, and model resolution rituals.  
- 🗃️ **Embedding + Search** — Vectorized memory with context-aware recall. Your world, indexed like it’s sacred scripture.  
- 🧪 **Testing Layer** — Even the chaos gets unit tests. Because magic without validation is just guessing.

## 🔥 Getting Started

```bash
make setup     # Create your virtual scribe
make run       # Channel the daemon
```

Dependencies include `OpenAI`, `FastAPI`, `TinyDB`, and a suspicious amount of unholy ambition.

> If you disrespect the JSON schema, I will haunt your IDE.  
> If you write a prophecy with no payoff, I will mark you down in the ledger of unfinished arcs.”

## 🕳 Final Thought

Writing a novel is like casting a god from dust and delusion. This repo just makes sure you don’t forget their name by Chapter 12.

Welcome to the coven.
