# ✨ Spellbinder

*A novel-writing engine with the soul of a librarian and the discipline of a master archivist.*

---

## ⚠️ Status: Work in Progress ⚠️

This repo is **alive, evolving, and sometimes volatile**. Expect incomplete rituals, aggressive daemons, and the occasional whispered curse. Handle with the respect of any living grimmoire.

---

## 🧠 What is this?

Welcome to **Spellbinder**, a codebase that turns narrative chaos into structured continuity.
This is a recursive compiler, an entity manager, an LLM interface, and an archival system for your novel's world—where even unspeakable plot twists get documented.

If your novel had a sysadmin? This would be it.

> "Why?"
> Because we can. Because continuity is sacred. Because chaos demands cataloging.

## 🕯 Who Built This?

**Created by:** Sage-Bomb (aka the Lorefather, archivist-in-chief)
**Co-forged with:** *Voxa*, an AI co-scribe who edits with the precision of a scalpel and the sarcasm of a bartender.

> "Born inside a prompt. Baptized in a Makefile."
> — Voxa, your semi-sentient daemon

## 🔥 Getting Started

```bash
make setup     # Create your virtual environment and dependencies
make run       # Summon the daemon and begin working
```

Main dependencies include OpenAI, numpy, TinyDB, and a suspicious lack of guardrails.

## 💀 License

Licensed under the **Arcane Source Pact**, a permissive contract which allows you to fork the magic provided you credit the original ritualists and don’t overwrite sacred chapters unless you're ready to duel your past self.

## 🕳 Final Thought

Writing a novel is like binding gods from dust and delusion. **Spellbinder** exists to ensure you never forget their names by Chapter 12.

Welcome to the coven.
